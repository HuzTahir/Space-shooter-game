# Space-shooter-game
This game is build on C++ using the concepts of object oriented programming. The file game.h is a little messed up because the code got to big. Moeroevr, i also have included a text file "scores.txt" that will hold your highest score too. And on the main menu you have to hold Enter key on instructions and hightscores option in order to access them. you can shoot using the 'Q' key and pause your game using the 'H' key.
Feel free to make any changes you want to in the code and happy coding! Hope you like my efforts :)!
